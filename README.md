# ENPH-253

welcome to the robot #1 (aka the cook) code. 

There is a header file containing all the functions ever used for the robot. 

There is also a functions file that contains all of the functions definitions for the functions that are ever used by the robot.

There are test files, each of which contains testing functions that help segment and test different components of the code for the robot. 

Finally, there is a platformio.ini file that indicates how to format the project and it's respective environments so that we can perform the testing in different files.
